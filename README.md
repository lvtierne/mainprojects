# Completed Project

## 1. Model Development:
**Task:** Implement machine learning models capable of processing multi-domain sensor data for pilot training.

**Approach:**

- Choose suitable machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for processing raw sensor data.
- Utilize Python and libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.
- Train the models using simulated sensor data within designated simulation environments.
  
**Example (using TensorFlow for a CNN model):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define and compile the CNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(height, width, channels)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

data_sources = ['sensor_1', 'sensor_2']
input_parameters = {'param_1': 0.5, 'param_2': 1.0}
performance_metrics = ['accuracy', 'processing_time']

# Conduct experiments
for source in data_sources:
    for param in input_parameters:
        # Execute experiment with specified parameters

        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(experiment_results)
        processing_time = calculate_processing_time(experiment_results)
